    "1) We will chose a `user_id` in Twitter to be our first node. \n",

    "2) We will find (some) of the users who are both following `user_id` and are being followed by `user_id`. From now on we will call such users \"connections\" of `user_id`. We will place these user ids in a list called `first_nodes`. \n",

    "3) For every node in the list `first_nodes` we will then find (some) of the users who are following and are being followed by this node (aka the connections of this node). The user ids collected in this step will be placed in a list called `second_nodes`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) The collection of the ids of all nodes (aka Twitter users) that we have collected so far will be placed in a list called `all_nodes`.\n",

I have chosen the Twitter account of [Applied Machine Learning Days](https://www.appliedmldays.org) that will take place in January 2018 in EPFL. You may change that if you wish to, but please make sure that the user you chose has both followers and friends and that he allows you to access this data."
